Here is described what to take a look at

The main and most interesting - CampaignTrackingReceiver. Check the manifest, no dependencies to GA,
but when user installs application gplay sends a broadcast named="com.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER"
according to docs https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/android/v4/campaigns

This receiver takes this broadcast and parses incoming string to desired utm_* sources
Inside of receiver you will find TODO
Which will mark place where developer should simply place logic of sending events to analytics

To test, just use raw adb install with custom intent
